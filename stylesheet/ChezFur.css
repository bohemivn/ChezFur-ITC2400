much like an outline you create for a paper or presentation

    Enter special rules that apply to SOME SMALL SCREENS, if needed
    Be sure to enter a comment to help identify which small screen!
    Applying rules to specific pages usually involves using classes
    or tags that are unique to the page. (covered in the Classes
    modlue)
    Example:
    /*****About page rules below *******/

    
        /* I am commenting to show I was curious about touching this!*

        .aboutspecialclass {}
        
        leaving it in a comment because it upset me that it was throwing me cautions in the IDE*/

    Now it is time for the media queryrules that apply to
    LARGE SCREENS ONLY.
    If a rule was created for ALL SCREENS above, and you want to
    use the same rule, DO NOT REPEAT IT!
    Start with the media query. Remember that all the media query
    rules are NESTED witin the media query braces! Don't delete that
    last brace!
    For class purposes, use a screen width of 650px. (This is just
    to make it easy for me to grade, not because it is the "right"
    screen size for a smartphone.
    !!!!!THERE IS ONE AND ONLY ONE @media statement!!!!!
    Do not have a second one unless you asked to code for notebooks
    or devices with different sizes.
